#Orange Bot
In order to create a bot that monitors Twitter for negative/positive Home Depot experiences, a Twitter API was used to get tweets related to Home Depot. 
The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer was implemented to determine whether the tweet had a negative or positive feedback and then used the nodemailer API to send a report to a Home Depot attendant so they can contact the customer.<br/>
